                        <p className="concept-para1">The idea of building a B2B marketplace, came to us a few years ago. Experiencing the process of buying and selling in bulk: footwear, apparel etc... since early 2002 we’ve encountered issues and restrictions , we also faced lots of question from sellers and buyers, shipping issues etc... But at the end of this journey, we are now providing answers and solutions that will help our network and partners!</p>

                        <p className="concept-para1">And it is always the same questions that came to us from our suppliers: <br /> “Hey can you move apparel? I have too much of this brand etc...”, or “Can <br /> you buy any accessories?”, “Can you move soccer shoes?”, “I received <br /> another shipment of this model ;can you buy more or help me move more <br /> now?” etc...</p>
                        <p className="concept-para1">Well the answer was: “We don’t have any clients for those items, or let me <br /> ask around”</p>

                        <p className="concept-para1">In a utopian marketplace, the best option would be to move a bunch of <br /> footwear/apparel or else, in bulk (one shot), to: another reseller, store or <br /> wholesaler somewhere on planet earth.</p>
                        <p className="concept-para1">Well, there are no B2B marketplaces anywhere that deal with: limited/ <br /> hyped goods, or a marketplace where stores (with no brand account) & <br /> reseller could buy from (in bulk prices footwear, apparel, accessories) <br /> without any boundaries or questions! So let's try and create that platform: <br /> so other store owners & resellers/wholesalers worldwide could profit <br /> from!</p>

                        <p className="concept-para1">Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do they <br /> do? They flip them on well known resell platform/marketplace; and we <br /> are all very familiar with these marketplaces... . How can you sell some <br /> Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are offering a price of 20-35% under <br /> retail? Simple, if you are not the store yourself or a person who bought <br /> them at roughly 35% to 40% off retail... then forget it!</p>
                        <p className="concept-mid-name">So, as a store owner, we see 3 options :</p>
                        <p className="concept-para1">1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one etc. <br /> (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so it’s a loss).Shipping <br /> will take a while, and you are wasting time & labor...</p>

                        <p className="concept-para1">3:&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least : Sell them on a platform in bulk anonymously, with <br /> or without a discount ! Allowing your Hyped or general merchandise <br /> release inventory to reach multiple stores/resellers in the USA and <br /> worldwide . Forget the classic individual B2C (business to consumer) <br /> model and , aim at other stores/ wholesalers .The Hype around <br /> the footwear, Apparel, Accessory resell market is wide and active! There <br /> are many options out there that need to be exploited!</p>
